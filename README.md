## What is RxNorm?

**RxNorm** is two things: a normalized naming system for generic and branded drugs; and a tool for supporting semantic interoperation between drug terminologies and pharmacy knowledge base systems. The National Library of Medicine (NLM) produces RxNorm.

### Purpose of RxNorm
Hospitals, pharmacies, and other organizations use computer systems to record and process drug information. Because these systems use many different sets of drug names, it can be difficult for one system to communicate with another. To address this challenge, RxNorm provides normalized names and unique identifiers for medicines and drugs. The goal of RxNorm is to allow computer systems to communicate drug-related information efficiently and unambiguously.

### Scope of RxNorm
RxNorm contains the names of prescription and many over-the-counter drugs available in the United States. RxNorm includes generic and branded:

### Clinical drugs
Pharmaceutical products given to (or taken by) a patient with therapeutic intent
Drug packs
packs that contain multiple drugs, or drugs designed to be administered in a specified sequence
Non-therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, bulk powders, contrast media, food, dietary supplements, and medical devices are all out-of-scope for RxNorm. Medical devices include but are not limited to bandages and crutches.
